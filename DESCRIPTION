Description: serotrackr is a package specifically developed to help users prepare their raw data for submission to the SeroTracker platform. 
    This happens through several steps represented by one function each; 1) mapping the columns from raw data to those required for submission, 2) cleaning the raw data, 3) generating aggregate estimayes, 4) adjusting the estimates, 5) exporting the final data to a xlsx file where the remaining fields can be filled out by the user before submission on SeroTracker.com.
