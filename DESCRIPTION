Description: serotrackr is an R package that helps users prepare their raw data 
  for submission to the SeroTracker platform. It has functions to 1) validate 
  the raw data, 2) locate region names and convert them to standard region 
  codes, 3) aggregate data into estimates, and 4) save the results to an Excel 
  document, which will then be submitted on SeroTracker.com.
