Description: serotrackr is a package specifically developed to help users 
  prepare their raw data for submission to the SeroTracker platform. This 
  happens through several steps represented by one function each; 1) mapping 
  the columns from raw data to those required for submission, 2) cleaning the 
  raw data, 3) generating aggregate estimayes, 4) adjusting the estimates, 
  5) exporting the final data to a xlsx file where the remaining fields can be 
  filled out by the user before submission on SeroTracker.com.
